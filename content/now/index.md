What am I up to right now (May 2023)?

Hanging out in Sydney with the family while working on Moorebank Avenue Relocation Works (MARW) for GHD with National Intermodal.

Working on the Jiu-Jitsu puzzle, which encourages me to be fighting fit.

Books I'm reading right now: 

- [The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13528359-the-outpost)

This page was inspired by Derek Sivers and his work at http://nownownow.com/. Most Websites (personal and professional) have an about page to let you know what they are about, funny that. A now page is a way of letting visitors know what you spending your time on right now.
