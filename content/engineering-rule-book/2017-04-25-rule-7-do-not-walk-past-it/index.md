> The standard you walk past, is the standard you accept. â€“ David Morrison

Be it a safety concern, poor workmanship or bad behaviour if you close your eyes and walk past it then you are accepting it. You are saying that you are not concerned and feel free to keep doing it without correction.

To live by this rule means difficult conversations, extra work and extra responsibility. Not everyone goes looking for or wants these things. But ignoring this rule leads to regret, disappointment and mediocrity.

Big problems can often be avoid by addressing small problems that come past you. So don't ignore the small problems, by walking past them. Instead get out in front of them and avoid the big ones.
