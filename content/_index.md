# Ian Teda

> Hi, I am Ian Teda and this my story so far:

___

I enjoy an adventure, exploring what is around the next corner while trying to be the best version of myself. My current and most thrilling adventure is raising my three sons with my lovely wife.

I have been fortunate to work as a Civil Engineer on some amazing projects within NSW and ACT Australia. Some highlights that I am proud to say I was involved in including: 
- balanced cantilever segmental bridges
- drywell intake tower and RCC dam
- bulk earthworks
- the manufacture of precast concrete structures
- the Sydney Light Rail design
- school redevelopments

My hard work and determination has come with the satisfaction of seeing large infrastructure projects born from design concepts to reality, projects that I am proud to tell my boys I have worked on and help create.

I chose to be authentic through honesty, integrity and transparency. With a spirit for creativity, imagination and adventure. Striving to be uncomfortable by being curious, learning, growing and reflecting. Looking for freedom through the discipline of habit. But most of all, I am trying to be useful by adding value to my work and who I am. â€“ Ian Teda
