On the subject of character,

> The best index to a person's character is how he treats people who can't do him any good, and how he treats people who can't fight back. – [Abigail Van Buren](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9940-the-best-index-to-a-person-s-character-is-how-he)

Your character is essentially what you do, your actions. And your actions are largely a result of your habits. That is to say, your character is a collection of your habits -- learned behaviours to particular events. [So know yourself, know your habits](/blog/know-be-love-yourself/). Be conscious of the small things because the small things make up who you are and what others see of your character.

> Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking – [H. Jackson Brown, Jr.](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/h_jackson_brown_jr_101336?src=t_character)

The best reflection of your character is the way you behave when nobody else is looking. When peer pressure and the need to confirm to the tribe does not influence your actions. Good character is essentially doing what is right. Trusting a person, is trusting there character to do what is right. Even when it is not easy and may affect them personally.

Be conscious of who your friends are. Their character. As birds of a feather, flock together. You are most comfortable around people similar to yourself. But that may not be the person (character) you want to be. Choose your friends wisely, as you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.
