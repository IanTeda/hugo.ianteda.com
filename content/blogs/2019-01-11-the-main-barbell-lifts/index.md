The main lifts are called that because they use the most muscles over the longest range of motion. Giving you the most effective use of your training time. Another way to think of it that they use the most joints over the longest range of motion, working the entire body as a coordinated system -- a.k.a composite lifts.

The primary lifts:

1. Squat
2. Deadlift
3. Bench Press
4. Overhead Press

Our initial focus should be on learning the movements, understanding what good form feels like and getting strong with the primary lifts.

Once we start moving past the initial gains in the primary lifts we can start to introduce ancillary lifts. 

Ancillary lifts:

- Power Cleans
- Pull Ups
- Push Ups
- Rows
- Dips
