A training or workout split is the way your training is divide or split up. 

A split is about programming workouts to stress your body past its current equilibrium and to move you towards a specific goal. The stress triggers your body to adapt to stress and get stronger. But, without enough recovery in between workouts you can become over stressed. Meaning you will not be able to train the next session.

> It is not the lifting that gets you stronger, it is the eating and recovery.

### Initial Strength Gains

The first goal with training should be to develop a base level strength. This is best done through a linear progression of weight. Where we increase weight on the bar by 5, 2.5, even 1 kilogram, each workout until we can no longer add weight between sessions. 

When you feel like you are reaching the end of the initial strength gains, ask yourself the [first three questions](https://startingstrength.com/article/the_first_three_questions) put forward by Mark Rippetoe:

Have you:

1. Had adequate rest, between sets, between sessions and sleep?
2. Made to big a jump between sets and overstressed the body?
3. Been eating enough protein and carbs (marcos) at the right ratios?

### The "Starting" Strength Split

The standard linear progression prescribed by [Starting Strength](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B006XJR5ZA/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_N5rwCbNRXTYYH) is a three day split. Typically done, on a Monday, Tuesday and Friday. With a rest day in between and two day rest at the end of the split. It can be done on different days of the week, to better suit your schedule but the typical split is made up of:
DayMovement 1Movement 2Movement 3MonSquats @60x3x5Bench Press @40x3x5Dead Lifts @80x3x5TueRestWedSquats @65x3x5Overhead Press @25x3x5Dead Lifts @85x3x5ThuRestFriSquats @70x3x5Bench Press @42.5x3x5Dead Lifts @90x3x5SatRestSunRest
### A Four Day Starting Strength Split

I wanted to train everyday, because I knew I wasn't going to be able to train everyday. So I programmed the four day linear progression split below. The theory being I had a days rest between leg and upper body workouts. And two days at the end of the split.
DayMovement 1Movement 21Squats @60x3x5Dead Lifts @80x3x52Bench Press @40x3x5Overhead Press @25x3x53Metbolic Conditioning4Squats @65x3x5Dead Lifts @85x3x55Bench Press @42.5x3x5Overhead Press @27.5x3x56Metbolic Conditioning7Rest
### Increments

Start by doing 5 kilogram jumps on lower body lifts and 2.5 kilogram jumps on upper body lifts. Once the grind to achieve a lift becomes to long, decrease the increments down to 2.5 kilograms for lower body and 1 kilogram for upper body lifts.

If you are struggling to recover between workouts Â -- particularly if you are over 35 -- it is time to change your split to maybe a Heavy-Light-Medium (HLM).

If you are still young, with lots of testosterone then check out the Texas Method.
