If there is one thing you can do that will positively impact more parts of your life then any other, it is working on your strength. 

Strength is the basis for all human movement. It helps in injury prevention, recovery and rehabilitation from injury. You use your strength getting off the toilet, picking up the washing basket and running for the bus.

Evolution rewarded those that had the strength to survive. The stronger you where, the more you ate, the dryer you stayed and bettered the chances of your children surviving to pass on your DNA. We all have the ability to be stronger. Our body crave it, want it.

> Physical strength is the most important thing in life. This is true whether we want it to be or not. As humanity has developed throughout history, physical strength has become less critical to our daily existence, but no less important to our lives. Our strength, more than any other thing we possess, still determines the quality and quantity of our time here in these bodies. Whereas previously our physical strength determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed, it now merely determines how well we function in these new surrounding we have crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated. But we are still animals -- our physical existence is, in the final analysis the only one that actually matters. A week [person] is not as happy as the same [person] would be if he were strong
