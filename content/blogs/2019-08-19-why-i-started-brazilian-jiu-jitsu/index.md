The other day I was asked, why I started training Brazillian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)? At first I started giving the why I train BJJ, but realised mid explanation that they are not the same question. That the reasons I keep training not necessarily the reasons I started.

Like a lot of people I am a lover, not a fighter.Â But I was uncomfortable not knowing how to defend myself.

Self defence is a life skill, just like swimming. You may believe that learning to swim is a waste of time because you plan to stay away from water. But if you find yourself in the water, or someone you care about does, then not knowing how to survive or keep those you care about safe could get you in deep water quickly.

> If you don't know how to defend yourself, violence chooses you, whether you like it or not.

Everyone should learn to defend themselves. Not because violence is the answer, but because most peoples opinions of there fighting ability is overrated. Just like learning to swim teaches you respect for the water and it's dangers. Learning how to fight teaches humility and helps avoid fights. You learn what can happen, that you never know what the other person could do.

> Some times appropriate violence is necessary.

We often mistake cowardice for morals. It takes people -- i.e. the police -- that know there beast to protect and serve. But we all have a responsibility to maintaining the peace. If you do not know how to defend others that cannot, all you can do is standby and watch while filming on your phone.
