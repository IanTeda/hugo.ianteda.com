What am I up to right now? 1st January 2019!
Hanging out with the Wife and Boys in Sydney, while working on the Sydney Light Rail Design with GHD and the Design Joint Venture.
Trying to get stronger in body and mind by perusing barbell training with Starting Strength and some self defence with Jiu Jitsu and Higher Jiu Jitsu.

Books I'm reading right now:

This page was inspired by Derek Sivers and his work at http://nownownow.com/. Most Websites (personal and professional) have an about page to let you know what they are about, funny that. A now page is a way of letting visitors know what you spending your time on right now.
