Hello, and thank you for visiting [ianteda.com](/), my little corner of the Internet.

I created [ianteda.com](/) to be useful. First, by sharing content around ideas, thoughts and projects, I am working on. Second,  I wanted to build and manage my - Ian Teda - professional image, brand and authority, practice my writing and develop ideas by articulating them in writing.

The concept of being useful came from Scott Adams[^1], the creator of the Dilbert Cartoons. The answer to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is not 42 but "be useful". Need a business idea? How can you be useful? What should I do in life? Be useful. How can I get people to like me? Be useful.
