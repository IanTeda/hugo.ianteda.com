'know yourself, be yourself, love Yourself\nKnow Yourself: Step back from the movie being played in your head and examine your habits, your motives and your desires from the outside in. Do they reflect who you want to be, where you want to be, and what your goals and priorities are? To know yourself is to detach from your ego and ask why?\nBe Yourself: Be aware of your motives, examine your desires and reflect on your actions. Do they reflect who you want to be? Do they reflect the character you want to be? If they do not, then change. If they do, then don't let others change you. There is only one person you need to please and that is yourself.\nLove Yourself: You will never be able to love others and others will find it hard to love you if you first do not love yourself. To love yourself is to be proud and confident in who you are. Ask yourself am I proud of what I'm about to do? If not, don't do it.\nDo your habits reflect your goals, does your character reflect the person you want to be, do you love yourself and the person you are? If not, take action.

Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different. The skill comes in first realising this, being comfortable with the contradictions and knowing how to find the balance.\nRule 2, is a little bit of an abstract concept. But it is important as it adds context and framing to a lot of the other rules -- i.e. a rule may be highlighting an extreme, but it doesn't mean you should live at the extreme.\nThe safest way to build something is not to build it at all. But that doesn't get things built. The answer is you need to do both. It needs to be built and it needs to be built safely.\nShould I micro-manage or macro-manage? The answer is you should do both. There are times when you need to focus on the detail to make sure things run smoothly, but you will get to a level of micro where the return on your time does not warrant the focus and you need to execute and step back into the macro so you can first see where you need to adjust and then make the adjustment. The return is in the execution, but if you don't put enough time into the detail the execution will fail.\nShould I be a good cop or a bad cop? The answer is both. You must be able to go to the extremes of being angry and passive and be able to recognise when and how to deploy each of them. But you cannot live life at the extreme of either. You need to be able to defend your ideas, but if you never change your mind people will not approach you with what could be the answer.\nWhen faced with opposing views, often the answer is both.\nCheck out The Engineering Rule Book for the other rules.\n","link":"https://ianteda.github.io/hugo.ianteda.com/blogs/rule-2-often-the-answer-is-both/","section":"blogs","tags":["Engineering","Rules"],"title":"Rule 2 - Often The Answer Is Both"},{"body":"","link":"https://ianteda.github.io/hugo.ianteda.com/tags/rules/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Rules"},{"body":" Your job is to make money. By building it safely, building it once and leaving a positive legacy\n“What do think your job is?”. It is a question I like to ask graduate engineers as they are starting in construction because it helps to orientate them as they start life in the workforce and start in construction.\nWhat is your job? Your job as a construction engineer is to make money for your employer, XYZ Constructions. You are not there for practice and you are not working for XYZ Construction Charities. XYZ Constructions is paying you a salary of $X with the intention that you return $(X+1). They are looking for a return on their investment, your salary.\nWith that reality understood, it is important to highlight that the best way to make money in construction is by building it safely, building it once (quality) and leaving a positive legacy.\nSay you have two identical projects and on one project someone gets hurt, they have to build it twice and they allow pollution into a local river. Which project will make more money?\nSafety Fully appreciating the personal impact on those involved in a safety incident and the negative legacy it leaves behind, if you are worried about meeting the program and budget then the last thing you need is a safety incident.\nIf you consider your project budget has a 10% profit built in and work gets affected for one week, then the project will need to perform at optimum efficiency for the next 100 weeks just to get out of the red and into the budget.\nThe best way to make money is to do the job safely and avoid any lost time injuries.\nQuality Cutting corners is a short game, you may win once or twice but in the end probability always wins and you will have on your hands rework. So keep in mind and respect Rule 6 - The Six P's: Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance. By planning the work, communicating the plan, monitoring the performance of the plan and adapting when needed.\nThe best way to make money is to do the job once and do it right\nLegacy Legacy is about what you leave behind. A positive legacy is leaving things better than how you found them. And the legacy you leave behind is your reputation, your promise and your promise is your brand. If your clients do not trust your brand then you will soon have no work on hand. While it is important to live in the present, don’t lose focus on the long game.\nLeaving behind a negative legacy for those that work for you, the clients that pay the bills and the community that will use what you build — which is often the case with construction projects — you will soon discover that: no one will want to work for you and you are only as good as the people that work for you; clients will not engage you and without clients, there will be no money coming in; and your project will be known as the one. The one that polluted, the one that churned through employees, or the one that is falling apart.\nThe best way to make money is to leave behind a positive legacy. It is through that legacy that you add value. And if your client sees the value they will be happy to have you build something else (for the right price).\nCheck out The Engineering Rule Book for the other rules.\n","link":"https://ianteda.github.io/hugo.ianteda.com/blogs/rule-1-make-money.html/","section":"blogs","tags":["Engineering","Rules"],"title":"Rule 1 - Your Job Is To Make Money"},{"body":" Head Shot\nHello, and thank you for visiting ianteda.com, my little corner of the Internet.\nI created ianteda.com to be useful.
